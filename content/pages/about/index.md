Welcome to my corner of the internet.

I'm Joel Zamboni, and this blog is where I explore ideas that fascinate meâ€”AI and its implications for work and society, philosophical questions about consciousness and meaning, political systems and how they shape human flourishing, and spiritual perspectives that help make sense of our place in the universe.

## What You'll Find Here

This isn't a business blog or a professional platform. It's a space for **thinking out loud** about the big questions that matter:

- **AI and the Future of Work**: How artificial intelligence is reshaping not just jobs, but the entire structure of human knowledge and creativity
- **Philosophy**: Questions about consciousness, reality, truth, and what it means to be human in an increasingly automated world  
- **Politics**: Systems thinking about democracy, regulation, and how societies can organize themselves for genuine human flourishing
- **Religion and Spirituality**: Explorations of meaning, purpose, and the deeper patterns that connect us to something larger than ourselves

## My Approach

I write for **clarity over cleverness**. Each post includes a TLDR section because your time matters. I'm more interested in exploring ideas than winning arguments, and I regularly update posts as my thinking evolves.

The publication dates reflect when I first made these thoughts available, but I treat this as a living collection of ideas rather than a static archive.

## Background

I'm a father of teenagers, which gives me a front-row seat to watching the next generation navigate a world being transformed by AI. This perspective deeply influences how I think about skills, education, and what we're preparing young people for.

Professionally, I work at the intersection of technology and human systems, which informs my writing about automation, regulation, and the unintended consequences of well-meaning policies.
