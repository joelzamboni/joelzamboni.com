# Get in Touch

I'm always interested in thoughtful conversations about the ideas I explore hereâ€”AI and automation, philosophical questions about consciousness and meaning, political systems, and spiritual perspectives on our place in the universe.

## Social Media

The best way to reach me is through social media:

- **Twitter/X**: [@joelzamboni](https://twitter.com/joelzamboni) - Quick thoughts, AI discussions, and real-time conversations about the future of work
- **Instagram**: [@joelzamboni](https://www.instagram.com/joelzamboni/) - Personal insights, behind-the-scenes content, and visual storytelling
- **YouTube**: [@joelzamboni](https://www.youtube.com/@joelzamboni) - In-depth video content on AI, philosophy, and societal change

Follow me across platforms to stay updated on my latest thoughts about AI's impact on society, philosophical explorations, and insights into building a more thoughtful future.

## Email

For more in-depth discussions, collaborations, or if you'd prefer not to use social media, you can reach me at:

**hello [at] joelzamboni [dot] com**

## What I'm Interested in Discussing

- **AI and the Future of Work**: Practical implications of automation, preparing the next generation, policy considerations
- **Philosophy and Consciousness**: Questions about intelligence, meaning, and what makes us uniquely human
- **Political Systems**: How societies can organize for genuine human flourishing
- **Spirituality and Religion**: Non-dogmatic explorations of meaning and our connection to something larger
- **Parenting in the AI Age**: Practical skills and perspectives for raising teenagers in a rapidly changing world

## Response Time

I aim to respond within a few days, though sometimes it takes longer during busy periods. I read everything sent my way and appreciate thoughtful messages, even if I can't always respond individually.

## A Note on Debates

I'm much more interested in **exploring ideas together** than in winning arguments. If you're looking for a fight or want to prove someone wrong on the internet, you'll probably be disappointed. If you're genuinely curious about different perspectives and want to think through complex questions together, I'd love to hear from you.

Thanks for reading, and I look forward to the conversation.
